## Pre-work - _Memory Game_

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Jason Lin**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/hushed-sponge-curve

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Random Pattern is chosen by Computer every time a webpage is refreshed

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

    Stack Overflow- I utilized this to understand the filling of arrays with random numbers in JavaScript
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1527803/generating-random-whole-numbers-in-javascript-in-a-specific-range

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   A challenge I encountered in creating this submission was not being able to utilize the HTML tags and manipulating them because of my lack of knowing the libraries included in JavaScript. This gave me a bit of difficulty in coding out the times and how to utilize what JavaScript itself offers.
   Part of the challenge I encountered was just trying to learn the JavaScript syntax and libraries. To overcome my lack of understanding of what JavaScript provides, I looked up the libraries and the included
   functions JavaScript already provides such as the sound or event oriented programming. I also tried implementing JavaScript in other web projects that I was in the process of coding up. By making use of the language more often, I overcome the barrier of not knowing the language. What ended up helping me overcome this barrier was Stack Overflow as well as other information about JavaScript on the Internet.
   I am also more used to the syntax of languages such as Java and C, so I had to adjust to the JavaScript syntax and not make everything based on classes. Overall, the challenge was just to learn JavaScript along with its syntax and utilize it with HTML elements.
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I am very new with web development, so there are many things I would like to learn such as implementing services and games. After completing this small project, the questions I have about about web development include: How can I create an account management system with a website?, Is JavaScript the only language I can use with web development? How can I implement on online multiplayer game using JavaScript?. There is just so much I can learn about web development. Finally, I wonder if there is a tool that would help with the HTML and CSS since those were what I was annoyed with the most.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would try implementing more functions and adding additional features to the site. One example of a function I would've added was generating a random amount of buttons in the range from 1-6. This would change the game by making it a bit harder since there are more buttons to keep track of. An example of an additional feature I would've included if I had more time would be the addition of difficulty levels so that the user can choose whether they want the game to be harder or not.
